%description

BRL-CAD is a powerful cross-platform Open Source combinatorial
Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) solid modeling system that
includes interactive 3D solid geometry editing, high-performance
ray-tracing support for rendering and geometric analysis,
network-distributed framebuffer support, image and
signal-processing tools, path-tracing and photon mapping
support for realistic image synthesis, a system performance
analysis benchmark suite, an embedded scripting interface, and
libraries for robust high-performance geometric representation
and analysis.


For more than 20 years, BRL-CAD has been the primary tri-service
solid modeling CAD system used by the U.S. military to model
weapons systems for vulnerability and lethality analyses. The
solid modeling system is frequently used in a wide range of
military, academic, and industrial applications including in
the design and analysis of vehicles, mechanical parts, and
architecture. The package has also been used in radiation
dose planning, medical visualization, computer graphics
education, CSG concepts and modeling education, and system
performance benchmark testing among other purposes.

BRL-CAD supports a great variety of geometric representations
including an extensive set of traditional CSG primitive
implicit solids such as boxes, ellipsoids, cones, and tori,
as well as explicit solids made from closed collections of
Uniform B-Spline Surfaces, Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline
(NURBS) surfaces, n-Manifold Geometry (NMG), and purely faceted
mesh geometry. All geometric objects may be combined using
boolean set-theoretic CSG operations including union,
intersection, and difference.

BRL-CAD has been under active development with a portability
heritage that includes systems such as a DEC VAX-11/780
running 4.3 BSD; DECStations running ULTRIX; Silicon Graphics
3030, 4D "IRIS", O2, Onyx, and Origin systems running various
versions of IRIX; Sun Microsystems Sun-3 and Sun-4 Sparcs
running SunOS; the Cray 1, Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, and Cray 2
running UNICOS; DEC Alpha AXP running OSF/1; Apple Macintosh
II running A/UX; iPSC/860 Hypercube running NX/2; the Alliant
FX/8, FX/80, and FX/2800; Gould/Encore SEL PowerNode6000/9000
and NP1; NeXT workstations; IBM RS/6000; HPPA 9000/700
running HPUX; Ardent/Stardent; Encore Multi-Max; and much more.

BRL-CAD is a collection of more than 400 tools, utilities,
and applications comprising more than a million lines of
source code. The package is intentionally designed to be
extensively cross-platform and is actively developed on
and maintained for many common operating system environments
including for BSD, Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, and Windows
among others. BRL-CAD is distributed in binary and source
code form as free open source software (FOSS), provided
under Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved license terms.

Mike Muuss began the initial architecture and design of
BRL-CAD back in 1979. Development as a unified package
began in 1983. The first public release was made in 1984.
BRL-CAD became an open source project on 21 December 2004.

#  It is STRONGLY recommended that you DO NOT install BRL-CAD into /usr as
#  BRL-CAD provides several libraries that may conflict with other libraries
#  (e.g.  librt, libbu, libbn) on certain system configurations.
#
#  Since our libraries predate all those that we're known to conflict with and
#  are at the very core of our geometry services and project heritage, we have
#  no plans to change the names of our libraries at this time.
#
#  INSTALLING INTO /usr CAN MAKE A SYSTEM COMPLETELY UNUSABLE.  If you choose
#  to continue installing into /usr, you do so entirely at your own risk.  You
#  have been warned.
